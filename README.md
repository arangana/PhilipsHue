Control Philips Hue lights from Laptop over WiFi using javascript API

For this assignment, I was able to control philips hue lights from my laptop over WiFi using an open source Javascript library. The open source library is hosted on github - it can be found here https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api.

I have also submitted my javascript source code on github provided in class.

Steps

1) Before starting off with the API it is imperative that you have a Philips Hue account. If not you need to create one at https://www.meethue.com.

2) Once this is done, you can install the api from your command line tool by issuing this command - npm install node-hue-api. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

3) Before writing the code make sure to have connected the light to a lamp and also the Hue Bridge to the WiFi network using an ethernet cable. (I had already done this before when I controlled the lights via Android App).

4) With these steps, you are already ready to start writing code to control the lights!

5) Please refer to the github code submitted to see how the lights were controlled.
